      <h3>RAY is a club dedicated to supporting orphaned youth</h2>
      <h1>Vision</h1>
      <p>The vision of RAY is embodied in its name. The club strives to equip and nurture orphaned youth, so that they may find the capacity of resilience within themselves. Resilience is defined as "the capacity to recover quickly from difficulities"</p>
      <h1>Mission</h1>
      <p>How will we achieve this? We will create a safe and exciting environment in which kids can learn new skills, and participate in fun activities. We only go to the orphanage twice a month, our hope is that the kids can utilize the skills and activities we put together, in order to learn how to build and strengthen current and future relationships.</p>
      <!-- <p>RAY Club is a volunteer organization that visits an orphanage, providing friends as well as fellowship. We want the children to have time to develop relationships, rather than just receiving supplies. The ten board members gather every week to share ideas about what food and activities they need to prepare before visiting the orphange. They also work diligently to see if there are any difficulties or awkwardness among the volunteers. You can participate as a volunteer, and volunteers have the opportunity to receive Presidential and Leadership awards. From 8th grade to 12th grade, 50 volunteers visit the orphanage every two weeks to have fun and learn the importance of the family through RAY Club.</p>

      <p>In 2017, 750 Christmas presents were presented to children of the orphanage. I would like to extend my gratitude to the students and parents who have bene prepared with love. I would like to invite students in grades 8-12 who are interested in orphanage service by calling the phone number below. I would like to thank you for your continued sincereity during the 2017-2018 semester, which will last until June next year, so that the RAY Club activities will continue.</p> -->
